# Dupa

## Python Print Debuging mande fun(fart) way

Dupa debuging is an old and antic way of debuging source code by tracing.
You place `echo "dupa"` after each command or function in the debugged execution chain. 
So that you can find where the error is by looking where you code crashes and burns.
Usually you would add indexes, like that: `dupa 1`, `dupa 2`.

It is also a pun. Word `dupa` comes from polish languge 
and it means `ass` (not the animal). It is often use in context of a fail of some sort like:
`no to dupa`(well, fuck). Using this word during deep and
hard debugging sessions, proved soothing and allowed to
turn a disaster into fun. Fart jokes always rule!

It also is a word which is not normaly present in the code. 
Therefor it is easy to find and spot your data dumps in the jungle of logs.
It's also easy to grep it out off the code (well, print also, 
but sometimes I want to leave print). This package contains flake8
plugin to looking for the functions of this package and other swear words.
It also enforces good practices. The developer has to clean after
the debugging session, or someone will see an "dupa" :P. 

It helps me laugh and giggle knee deep in legacy code.

This is still a package under construction.
